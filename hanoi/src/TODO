What we'd like to do next is get each RP to send a print statement like:
"pi1 currently running process 1"
In order to do this while the solver code is running we'd need to write
the print statement and send all the print statements from all the hosts to
master. We should be able to do this using gather, but that's not working at
the moment. This gather command seems to be clashing with a later gather
command that's used to build the complete list of moves for the solution to
the tower of hanoi problem.
