We are currently trying to incorporate the code in hoststest.py in ~ of
pi@master to get the hanoi code to run on multiple hosts, i.e. multiple
raspberry pis! However, when we try and do that main can't find the moves
file that it needs to pass to the visualisation module. This is because the
solver hanoi_soln_par.py is gathering all the moves arrays to process root 0.
Process root 0 will usually be pi1, whereas it should be gathering at
pi@master since that's what's running the show!

It should be an easy fix to get all the gathering and creation of the full
moves list to happen on pi@master. We'll do that some other time.
