We have now got multiple RPs solving the tower of hanoi problem all at once
by running 1 separate process each. What we want to do is have each RP print
something like "I am RP 6 and am running process 6" as it runs during the
solver.

Unfortunately that hasn't worked because gathering all those strings from each
RP to the master didn't work. If master doesn't get them all it can't print
them all. Hence we've made a quick fix of just using the pre-made list of host
names to print out the messages before the solver even runs. It's a cheat, but
it does the job.
